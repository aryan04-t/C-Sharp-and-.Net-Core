# Layout Views: 

- Layout view is like a master view 
- If a view is common among different pages, then you can create that view as layout view and then you can use this layout again and again, like this DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of coding doesn't gets violated and the code base doesn't gets bulky because of duplicate code 
- Like header, footer, and navigation bars are common among most of the views in a website, so here you can create these components of website as layout views instead of coding them again and again in different views 
- A layout view is a partial view which can be used in other views 


# Note: 

- In views folder there is a shared folder, in that folder you can see layouts 
- Partial views naming start with underscore '_'

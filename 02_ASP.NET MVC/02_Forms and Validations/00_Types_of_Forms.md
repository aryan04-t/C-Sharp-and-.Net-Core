# Types of Forms: 

    1. Weakly Typed Forms: 
        - Here data is not explicitly bound to specific data model 
        - Form is accessed as a key value pair 
        - Key represents the form fields and the value represents the user input 
        - This allows developer to read and manipulate form directly without any need to create a model 

    2. In Strongly Typed Forms we define a data model that corresponds to the struture of the form data and then we read and manipulate data
